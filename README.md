# busStopSearch
Searching for bus stops' codes with coordinates estimation
Feed a list of coordinates (coordinates of nearby bus stops) into call(),e.g.((1.233,103.54354),(1.24234324,103.23432),(1.2343242,103.23434)...), any size will do, I have already defined an array list for you, busCoordinates.
Then, the call() function will set a series of markers at the coordinates you have selected, tap on the info window of the markers to access the bus stop bus arrival time info.

You can delete the part of the draggable marker as it is just used to get a series of coordinates of busstops for my testing which you should already have.
